# Functional Interface

- We can use lambda expression to instantiate functional interface to avoid bulky class implementation.
- Functional Interface can extend another interface only when it does not have any abstract method. (compile-time error)
- Functional Interface can be extended with another interface having default method only.
- Primitive Functional Interface [examples](/src/com/javafeatures/PrimitiveFuncInterfaceExample.java)
